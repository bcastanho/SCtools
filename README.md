This package is a work in progress compiling functions to make it easier
running placebo in space tests with synthetic control models and SCM
with multiple treated units. It relies heavily on the ‘Synth’ package.

In April 2023, the 'Synth' package was archived from CRAN, due to the archival of 'LowRankQP', a package it depends on. Therefore, the installation of both 'Synth' and 'SCtools' now require the steps outlined in the following link: https://bcastanho.github.io/install_sctools
